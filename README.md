# London_road_traffic_analysis
I have developed 5 years of London road traffic analysis using EDA, Sampling & Hypothesis test.
The traffic data from all over UK was retrieved from the government website and only London data was utilised for my project. 
The link to the traffic data is https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/#6/55.254/-6.053/basemap-regions-countpoints
The data consisted of over a decade from 2009 to 2021, however I had extracted last updated 5 years (2016 - 2021)
Using python, I had practised Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), random sampling method and hypothesis testing. 
In EDA, data visualisation was carried out and found that in 2018 and 2019 the traffic flow has increased compared to other years. 
This project would be my first run down on python and I would aspire to continue to contribute towards much more research works using python.
